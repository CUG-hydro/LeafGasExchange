\description{
% Solve for U given the set of equations R * U = D, where U is a vector
of length N, D is a vector of length N, and R is an N x N tridiagonal
matrix defined by the vectors A, B, C each of length N. A(1) and
C(N) are undefined and are not referenced.

    |B(1) C(1) ...  ...  ...                     |
    |A(2) B(2) C(2) ...  ...                     |
R = |     A(3) B(3) C(3) ...                     |
    |                    ... A(N-1) B(N-1) C(N-1)|
    |                    ... ...    A(N)   B(N)  |

The system of equations is written as:

   A_i * U_i-1 + B_i * U_i + C_i * U_i+1 = D_i

for i = 1 to N. The solution is found by rewriting the
equations so that:

   U_i = F_i - E_i * U_i+1
