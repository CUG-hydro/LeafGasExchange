# LeafGasExchange
An R package for fitting and simulating leaf level gas exchange
Model gas exchanges at the leaf level using a coupled stomatal conductance model (USO) and photosynthesis model (Farquhar) using an analytical solution of the different equations.
This package also gathers functions to import data from LICORS 6400 and 6800, Ô¨Åt and display the main types of curves obtained with a gas exchange device: AQ, Aci, Mcurves and simulate data.
